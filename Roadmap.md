# Roadmap

1. Finish every wargame
2. Make a proper graphic for each of them (svg)
3. Make a script to help (hints/knowledge needed)

## TODO

- make walthroughs interactive (script for generating the 'table of contents'? Or do it manually)
- script which gives hints about specific level
- resources page / section in every walkthrough
